<!--
--><p>The Jesus May Ball Committee is delighted to invite you to pick a Wildcard and join us at this year’s May Ball. Become entranced by Diamonds, kneel at the thrones of the King and Queen, and avoid any tricks by the Joker as you explore this years’ spectacular.</p><!--
--><p>Prepare to experience a night like no other. As the sun sets on Jesus College on the 15th June, and you stroll across the ancient courts. Here you can sample a wide range of food from across the world, help yourself to a delicious cocktail or grab a glass of fizz, before settling down to catch some of our carefully selected musicians, magicians, and comedians. Or, if you desire a different pace, hurtle around in the dodgems and dance the night away in our DJ tent.</p><!--
--><p>However you wish to spend your night, Jesus May Ball has something for you.</p>

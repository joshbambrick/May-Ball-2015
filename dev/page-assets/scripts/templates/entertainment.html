<!--
--><p>The entertainment at Jesus May Ball rarely disappoints. Previous balls have played host to such illustrious talent as: Scouting for Girls, Rizzle Kicks, Maverick Sabre, Clean Bandit, and even David Bowie, once upon a time.</p><!--
--><p>Our team are hard at work putting together an impressive line up for our main stage, where well known names will be joined by perennially popular tribute acts, as well as the very best of Cambridge musicians.</p><!--
--><p>Helping ease the stress of a difficult term with some comedy has traditionally been another strength of Jesus Ball. Past performers have included Simon Amstell, Russell Kane, and James Acaster, who are always bolstered by a strong line up of local and student acts. We are confident that you will enjoy what we have in store this year.</p><!--

					--><p>Tickets will be available in three types: standard, priority, and dining, priced at £137, £153, and £174 respectively. There will also be the option to make a £2 donation to our chosen charities as part of your ticket application.</p><!--
					--><p>After record demand last year led to the ball selling out in under four hours, some changes have been made to the number of guest tickets students will be able to buy this year. </p><!--
					--><p>On Launch Night on the 19<sup>th</sup> February, <strong>Priority</strong> and <strong>Dining</strong> tickets will go on sale in the bar at 17:30. Jesuans will be able to buy their own, and two guest tickets.</p><!--
					--><p><strong>Standard</strong> tickets will go on sale to Jesuans at 13:00 on the 20<sup>th</sup> February. For the first 3 days that tickets are on sale, you  will only be able to buy your own, and two guest tickets.</p><!--
					--><p>From 13:00 on 23<sup>rd</sup> February, the guest limit will be extended, to match the four guests from last year. After this time, anyone with an existing applications will be able to apply for an additional two guests, whilst any new applicants will be able to apply for four guests straight away. We believe that this new system will give everyone in college the opportunity to get tickets to the ball, whilst also still giving you the chance to invite all your friends along to the ball.</p><!--
					--><p>If any tickets remain after this initial round, they will go on sale to the rest of the university on the 27<sup>th</sup> February at 13:00.</p><!--

					--><dt class="info__faq-question">How many guest tickets can I buy?</dt><!--
					--><dd class="info__faq-answer">On Launch Night (in the bar) and for the first 72 hours that tickets are on sale online, you’ll be able to buy your own ticket and two guest tickets. From 13:00 on 23<sup>rd</sup> February, the guest limit will be extended to four guests.</dd><!--
					--><dt class="info__faq-question">But it was four guests last year - why is it two guest tickets now?</dt><!--
					--><dd class="info__faq-answer">Tickets sold out on the launch day within about four hours, before some people had even had a break from lectures. This didn’t give everyone from college an equal opportunity to buy tickets. Whilst we want people to be able to bring their friends to the ball, we think it’s only fair that everyone from Jesus who wants to buy a ticket is able to get one!</dd><!--
					--><dt class="info__faq-question">I want to buy three/four guest tickets – what is the best way to do this?</dt><!--
					--><dd class="info__faq-answer">Make an initial application during the first 72 hours after tickets go on sale and apply for your own ticket and two guest tickets at this time. Apply for any additional guest tickets once the guest limit has been extended.</dd><!--
					--><dt class="info__faq-question">When do I pay for the tickets?</dt><!--
					--><dd class="info__faq-answer">You need to pay for the tickets within 7 days of booking for them. However, if you add additional guests within these 7 days, then the deadline for the entire payment will be moved to 7 days after the date the additional guests were booked. Hopefully the examples in the table below will help make this a bit clearer.<!--

					--><dd class="info__faq-answer">Buy your own ticket straight away, then apply for all four guest tickets after the limit is extended – either all your friends will get tickets or none of them will. If you <em>really</em> want, then you can wait until the 23<sup>rd</sup> to book your own ticket too, but there are no guarantees tickets will be left.</dd><!--

					--><dd class="info__faq-answer">We did warn you! We can’t create extra tickets. Sign up for the waiting list, and you may get tickets.</dd><!--
					--><dt class="info__faq-question">I’m on the waiting list… now what?</dt><!--
					--><dd class="info__faq-answer">If any spare tickets become available (eg from people not paying for their tickets), we will contact people on the waiting list in the order they went on. You’ll stay on the waiting list until a few weeks before the ball, to give you the best chance of getting a ticket.</dd><!--
					--><dt class="info__faq-question">I’ve bought a ticket but I can’t make the ball anymore – what should I do?</dt><!--
					--><dd class="info__faq-answer">The Jesus May Ball doesn’t offer refunds – however, it is possible to transfer the ticket into another name, although there is a fee for this (some of this is donated to charity!). If you believe you should be exempt from this fee, contact the Ticketing Officer at <a href="mailto:tickets@jesusmayball.com">tickets@jesusmayball.com</a>, but don’t be surprised if your request is rejected.</dd><!--

				--><p>Jesus May Ball is currently looking for motivated and enthusiastic workers to help make this year’s Ball a success. There are a variety of roles available, including food and drink workers, security stewards, and entertainment runners, as well as the opportunity to take on a leadership position in the capacity of a Team Leader or Court Supervisor.</p><!--
				--><p>We <strong>do not</strong> operate a 'half-on, half-off' employment policy like many May Balls, and workers are offered a <strong>competitive rate which starts at £65</strong> for the night and increases for certain roles.</p><!--
				--><p>Applicants must be willing to work as part of a team and should demonstrate charisma and enthusiasm in order to make the 15th of June a spectacular night. Previous experience in hospitality or May Balls is not essential, and training will be given in the week preceding the Ball.</p><!--
				--><p>This is a great opportunity to be a part of one of the most exciting events of the year whilst earning some money. Applications close on the 27th February, with <strong>interviews being held on the 7th or 8th of March</strong>. To apply, please complete our online application form, or email us for more information at <strong><a href="mailto:staffing@jesusmayball.com">staffing@jesusmayball.com</a></strong>.</p><!--

				--><h4 class="job-descriptions__heading">Job Descriptions</h4><!--
				--><h5>Team Leader<span class="job-descriptions__job-pay"> - £85</span></h5><!--
				       --><div class="job-descriptions__description">Team Leaders will oversee all the workers for one team of the Ball. They are responsible for ensuring that everyone on their team is confident in what they are doing and all work is completed to a satisfactory standard. Attention to detail is essential to success in this role, as is the ability to handle pressure and use their initiative should any issues arise; excellent communication skills are also imperative. In addition, Team Leaders are responsible for signing their team in and out at the start and end of the Ball. Previous leadership experience is essential for the role, and applicants must be able to demonstrate that they can motivate and manage a team.</div><!--
				--><h5>Court Supervisor<span class="job-descriptions__job-pay"> - £75</span></h5><!--
				       --><div class="job-descriptions__description">Court Supervisors are responsible for ensuring everything operates smoothly in their designated court or area. This involves communicating with Team Leaders and relevant members of the committee when any issues arise or extra staffing is required. Court Supervisors are also responsible for signing in and out workers at the beginning and end of their breaks. Previous leadership experience is essential for the role, and applicants must be able to demonstrate that they can motivate and manage a team. Court Supervisors should also be able to use their initiative and work well under pressure.</div><!--
				--><h5>Food Drinks Worker<span class="job-descriptions__job-pay"> - £65</span></h5><!--
				       --><div class="job-descriptions__description">The role of the food and drinks worker is varied, and workers will be rotated to a variety of different positions throughout the night; therefore it is important for workers to be adaptable. The position mainly involves preparing and serving food and drink, as well as ensuring food and drink stalls are well-stocked.  Experience in hospitality or catering is helpful, and a friendly and professional disposition is essential.</div><!--
				--><h5>Security Steward<span class="job-descriptions__job-pay"> - £65</span></h5><!--
				       --><div class="job-descriptions__description">The role of the security stewards is twofold. They are firstly responsible for reporting anyone attempting to enter the Ball without a valid ticket; however, at no point will they be expected to directly confront or remove any unauthorised persons themselves. Stewards are also responsible for the overall health and safety of guests, which involves fire stewarding and reporting any guests that conduct themselves in an inappropriate or dangerous manner. Security stewards must be diligent and professional.</div><!--
				--><h5>Ents Runner<span class="job-descriptions__job-pay"> - £65</span></h5><!--
				       --><div class="job-descriptions__description">The role of the ents runners is to escort acts to the correct stage at the correct time, and to help ensure that the entertainment schedule for the night runs smoothly. Timekeeping and organisation is imperative, as is the ability to stay calm under pressure.</div><!--
				--><h5>On-Call Team<span class="job-descriptions__job-pay"> - £65</span></h5><!--
				       --><div class="job-descriptions__description">Workers on the on-call team will be allocated different roles and responsibilities throughout the night, depending on where staffing is needed. This may involve responding to emergencies that arise. It is therefore imperative that workers can operate under pressure and are able to use their initiative. The role may also involve stepping in where certain teams or areas are understaffed, meaning workers must be adaptable to new situations and receptive to instruction. This is perhaps one of the most interesting roles due to its varied nature.</div><!--
				--><h5>Glass Collection Worker<span class="job-descriptions__job-pay"> - £65</span></h5><!--
				       --><div class="job-descriptions__description">The glass collection team are responsible for collecting dirty glasses, washing them using the college dishwashers and then returning them to the bars and drink stalls. Workers will be rotated to different areas throughout the night in order to keep their work varied. This role is essential for both the running of the bars and for the overall aesthetics of the Ball.</div><!--
				--><h5>Litter Collection and Recycling Worker<span class="job-descriptions__job-pay"> - £65</span></h5><!--
				       --><div class="job-descriptions__description">The role of the litter collection and recycling team is to collect rubbish and litter throughout the night and ensure it is disposed of appropriately, recycling where possible. This is a highly important role in ensuring the Ball is both environmentally friendly and aesthetically-pleasing. Workers will be rotated to different areas throughout the night in order to keep their work varied.</div><!--
				--><h5>Cloakroom Attendant<span class="job-descriptions__job-pay"> - £65</span></h5><!--
				       --><div class="job-descriptions__description">The cloakroom attendants are responsible for manning the cloakroom during the Ball. They will have to operate in a systematic and organised way to ensure no belongings are lost throughout the course of the night, and must be particularly efficient during the rush of guests at the start and end of the Ball.</div><!--
